# Meridian — Project Context & Handoff

**ClickHouse & Trigger.dev Virtual Summer Hackathon 2026**
**Team of 2 · Person A (Saurav, backend/data/agent) + Person B (frontend/streaming)**
**Repo:** github.com/sauravhippargi/meridian
**Deadline:** submissions close midnight AoE, July 23, 2026

This document is the single source of truth for where the project stands. Read it top to bottom before doing any work.

---

## 1. What Meridian is

A chat agent for PMs at a fictional B2B SaaS company ("Meridian Payments," a Stripe-style payments company). The user is a PM on the Billing team preparing for Q4 planning. They ask questions like "what should we prioritize next quarter?" and the agent answers by reading across support tickets, customer interview transcripts, CRM deal data, and competitive intelligence.

**Responses are visual-first** — charts, matrices, evidence cards — not walls of text. This is the hackathon theme: "Beyond the Wall of Text." The judging lens is "ratio of insight to words."

### The demo narrative (the "opportunity truth")
The agent must correctly identify, from the seeded data:
1. **Usage-based billing enhancements** — #1 recommendation (`build_now`). Enterprise ARR, competitive urgency (Metronome/Orb ahead), blocked deals.
2. **Multi-entity consolidated invoicing** — #2 hidden gem (`build_next`). Small footprint but top-15 enterprise accounts, greenfield (no competitor has it).
3. **Dunning email customization** — correctly **deprioritized** despite highest raw ticket volume (mostly SMB accounts, no enterprise deals blocked). This is the "volume trap."
4. **LATAM tax handling** — `watch` (Q1, growing but not urgent).
5. Hybrid RevRec, webhook reliability, Salesforce sync, custom invoice PDFs — backlog.

### Three "wow" moments the demo must land
1. **Volume-trap detection** — dunning has the most tickets but the agent correctly does NOT rank it #1 (it's SMB-driven, low ARR).
2. **Hidden-gem surfacing** — multi-entity invoicing ranks #2 despite low volume because requesters are high-ARR enterprise.
3. **Provenance drill-down** — every claim traces back to exact source quotes (tickets, transcripts, deals).

---

## 2. Architecture

### Data layer (OLTP + OLAP — targeting the €1000 bonus prize)
- **Postgres (OLTP)** — mutable business records. Provisioned as a **ClickHouse-managed Postgres service** (not Neon — we switched to ClickHouse's managed Postgres so both databases live in one platform, which strengthens the OLTP+OLAP integration story). Holds: `accounts`, `deals`, `themes`, `competitors`, `raw_tickets`, `raw_transcripts`.
- **ClickHouse (OLAP)** — analytical store. Holds: `mentions` (the big append-only table, ~5,000 rows after extraction), `theme_scores_daily` (materialized view). Every agent query is an aggregation over this.

**Why both:** Postgres answers "current state of this account/deal" (transactional lookups on mutable data); ClickHouse answers "across all signal, what matters most?" (analytical aggregation). The Phase A4 sync task propagates changed fields (e.g. account ARR) from Postgres → ClickHouse to keep aggregations current. This is the textbook OLTP+OLAP pattern the bonus prize rewards.

### Agent layer
- **Trigger.dev `chat.agent()`** — REQUIRED by the hackathon. The agent orchestration must use this primitive, not a raw Next.js route or bare Vercel AI SDK. Background jobs (ingestion, extraction, sync) also run as Trigger.dev tasks with `batchTrigger` for fan-out.
- **Orchestration decision: HYBRID** — scripted chapter sequence for the main "what should we prioritize?" flow (for demo reliability), LLM-driven for follow-up questions. LLM reasoning goes into synthesis WITHIN each chapter (verdict text, callouts), not the sequencing between chapters.

### Frontend + streaming (Person B, DONE)
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + Recharts + framer-motion.
- The frontend consumes an **NDJSON stream of typed `StreamEvent`s** (defined in `types/chapter.ts`), NOT raw Trigger.dev tool-call events.
- **The integration seam is one interface:** `createAgentStream(body: ChatRequest): AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent>`, stubbed at `lib/agent-stream.ts` (compiles, throws until Person A implements). Person A yields typed StreamEvents; Person B owns NDJSON encoding (`app/api/chat/ndjson.ts`) + route wiring (`route.ts`).
- Reference for exact event ordering/pacing: `app/api/chat/mock/stream.ts` and `app/api/chat/mock/scenarios.ts`.

### LLM provider: Google Gemini (free tier)
- We switched from OpenAI to **Google Gemini** via `@ai-sdk/google` to use the free tier (no funded OpenAI key needed).
- Free tier: Gemini 2.5 Flash = 1,500 requests/day, 15 RPM, 1M TPM. Flash-Lite = 30 RPM. Pro models are NOT free (moved to paid April 2026).
- **Use Flash-Lite for generation, Flash for extraction and agent synthesis.**
- **Critical constraint:** the 15 RPM limit means the generator's concurrency must be LOWERED (from 5 to ~2-3) with 429-retry backoff, or it will hit the rate wall mid-run. You effectively get ONE full generation run per day on the free tier — so get the dry-run right before the full run.
- Env var: `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`.

---

## 3. THE STREAMEVENT CONTRACT (critical for Person A's agent work)

The frontend and agent communicate over a stream of typed `StreamEvent`s. Full types in `types/chapter.ts`. The union:

```ts
type StreamEvent =
  | { type: 'message_start'; message_id: string }
  | { type: 'status'; status: StatusUpdate }
  | { type: 'chapter_start'; chapter_id: string; title: string; icon: ChapterIcon }
  | { type: 'chapter_intro_delta'; chapter_id: string; delta: string }
  | { type: 'chapter_visual'; chapter_id: string; visual: ChapterVisual }
  | { type: 'chapter_callout'; chapter_id: string; callout: Callout }
  | { type: 'message_end'; message_id: string; headline: string }
  | { type: 'error'; message: string };
```

**Per-chapter event order (must honor):** `chapter_start` → `chapter_intro_delta`* → `chapter_visual` → `chapter_callout`*. Bracketed by `message_start` / `message_end{headline}`, with `status` events interleaved per query.

### The 7 visuals (ChapterVisual discriminated union)
Four are **pass-through** — their `data` is literally Person A's tool output from `types/agent-tools.ts`, no reshaping:
- `opportunity_ranking` ← `ListOpportunitiesOutput`
- `evidence_cards` ← `GetThemeEvidenceOutput`
- `competitor_matrix` ← `GetCompetitivePositionOutput`
- `impact_waterfall` ← `GetImpactProjectionOutput`

Three are **frontend-shaped** — Person B built the transforms (`lib/queries/transforms.ts`: `toStatRow` / `toVolumeTrap` / `toTrendLines`). Person A must produce these aggregate input shapes for them:
- `stat_row` ← needs `SignalSummary`
- `volume_trap` ← needs `ThemeVolumeStat[]`
- `trend_lines` ← needs `ThemeTrend[]`

**ACTION:** Person A must define `SignalSummary`, `ThemeVolumeStat[]`, `ThemeTrend[]` types (or get exact shapes from Person B) and produce them from the query functions. Person B's transforms handle the trap/gem/emphasis classification from raw numbers — no re-hardcoding needed for real data.

---

## 4. What is DONE

### Person A (backend) — Phase A1 code complete, committed, pushed
All Phase A1 files written and typecheck clean. NOT YET RUN against live services (that's the immediate next step).

**Committed files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — project context (read it)
- `types/` — `theme.ts`, `mention.ts`, `account.ts`, `agent-tools.ts`, `deal.ts`, `competitor.ts`, `raw-ticket.ts`, `raw-transcript.ts`
- `lib/db/clickhouse.ts` — client with `query<T>()` (returns `{data, rows, elapsedMs}`), `insertBatch<T>()` (chunks at 1000), `ping()`, `ClickHouseError`
- `lib/db/postgres.ts` — client with `query<T>()`, `queryOne<T>()`, `withTransaction()`, `ping()`, `PostgresError`, injection guard, `pg.types.setTypeParser(1700, parseFloat)` for NUMERIC→number
- `lib/db/schema.postgres.sql` — accounts, deals, themes, competitors, raw_tickets, raw_transcripts. UUID PKs (uuid-ossp), updated_at triggers on mutable tables, enums for segment + theme category, FK cascade rules
- `lib/db/schema.clickhouse.sql` — `mentions` (MergeTree, ORDER BY (theme_id, event_date), PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date), skip index on account_id, account_segment as Enum8) + `theme_scores_daily` materialized view (SummingMergeTree)
- `scripts/init-schema.ts` — idempotent schema applier (Postgres whole-file, ClickHouse statement-split). npm script: `db:init`
- `scripts/generate-data.ts` + `scripts/seed/*` (artifacts.ts, generators.ts, llm.ts, load-seeds.ts, plan.ts) — LLM data generator. npm scripts: `seed:load`, `seed:dry`, `seed:generate`

**Seed artifacts (committed, validated — all zod + cross-ref checks pass):**
- `data/seed/accounts.json` — 123 accounts (13 enterprise, 30 mid_market, 80 SMB), ~$11M total ARR, ALL REAL company names (Notion, Vercel, Retool, Linear, Airtable, Zapier, Miro, etc.)
- `data/seed/themes.json` — 8 themes with slugs (usage_based_billing, multi_entity_invoicing, dunning_customization, latam_tax, hybrid_revrec, webhook_reliability, salesforce_sync, custom_invoice_pdf)
- `data/seed/competitors.json` — 8 rows (7 competitors + 1 Meridian self-row with is_self:true), 20 features each as 'full'|'partial'|'none'
- `data/seed/opportunity-truth.json` — 8 truth themes with target_volume + 28 planted_accounts (4 blocked_deal roles: Retool→usage, Airtable→multi-entity, Attio→salesforce, Pilot→salesforce)

**Generation sizing:** ~956 tickets + 63 transcripts + 14 deals ≈ 1,033 LLM calls. blocked_deal accounts each get a deal row + a sev-5 transcript.

### Person B (frontend) — DONE
- Full frontend built, runs in mock mode, `tsc` + `next build` green.
- All 7 visual components built and rendering. Three wow moments work in mock.
- `INTEGRATION.md` in repo (commit a57e091 on branch `claude/hackathon-chat-frontend-hpii18`) — sections 3/4/8 detail the streaming contract. READ IT.
- Interface named: `createAgentStream(body): AsyncGenerator<StreamEvent>` stubbed at `lib/agent-stream.ts`.
- Transforms done: `lib/queries/transforms.ts` (toStatRow/toVolumeTrap/toTrendLines).
- Owns: route.ts wiring, NDJSON encoding, deployment dashboards (needs human auth — Saurav does this).

### Environment (DONE)
- `.env.local` created locally with: CLICKHOUSE_URL/USER/PASSWORD/DATABASE, POSTGRES_URL (ClickHouse-managed Postgres), GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY.
- Env vars also mirrored into Vercel.
- ClickHouse connectivity verified: `curl .../ping` returns `Ok.` from local machine.
- **NOTE:** the generator/schema currently reference `OPENAI_API_KEY` in places — must be switched to Gemini (`@ai-sdk/google`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`) with lowered concurrency for the 15 RPM free-tier limit. This is the first code change needed.

---

## 5. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (in order)

### Step 0 — Switch generator from OpenAI to Gemini ✅ DONE
- [x] `scripts/seed/llm.ts` now defaults to `@ai-sdk/google` + `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (env-overridable via `GEN_PROVIDER`/`GEN_MODEL`). Single `getModelName()` source of truth.
- [x] Concurrency lowered 5→2 (`GEN_CONCURRENCY`, default 2). Added a **global RPM pace-gate** (`GEN_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, default 2100ms ≈ 28/min) — caps the request *rate*, not just in-flight count.
- [x] `withRetry` upgraded to **429-aware backoff** (5→60s for rate limits, 1→4s for transient) with jitter.
- [x] `.env.example` documents `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` + generation tuning knobs; OpenAI/Anthropic marked optional.
- **Two infra fixes discovered while running (both flagged to Person A):**
  - [x] `lib/db/postgres.ts` — newer `pg` treats `sslmode=require` as verify-full and rejects ClickHouse-managed Postgres's cert; now strips `sslmode` from the URL and sets `ssl:{rejectUnauthorized:false}` (honors `sslmode=disable`).
  - [x] `scripts/init-schema.ts` — ClickHouse statement splitter now strips `--` line comments before splitting on `;` (a comment contained a semicolon → "Empty query").

### Step 1 — Run the data pipeline (finishes Phase A1)
1. [x] `npm run db:init` — ✅ Postgres (6 tables/3 triggers/4 enums) + ClickHouse `meridian` DB (mentions + theme_scores_daily MV) applied.
2. [x] `npm run seed:load` — ✅ 123 accounts / 8 themes / 8 competitors in Postgres.
3. [x] `npm run seed:dry` — ✅ **PASSED quality gate.** Switched generation provider to **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5** (`GEN_PROVIDER=anthropic`) — Gemini free tier surfaced `limit: 20`, too low for the run; the paid Anthropic key is reliable. Cross-theme samples: 8 themes represented, diverse interviewee names (contact-seeded), theme-appropriate severity, all planted blocked-deals (Retool→usage, Airtable→multi-entity, Attio→salesforce, Slite→latam) landed. ~$0.02 / 17 samples.
4. [x] `npm run seed:generate` — ✅ **DONE. Confirmed in Postgres, not just log output** (a prior attempt's misleading exit-code capture taught to always verify with a real `SELECT count(*)` — see the provider saga below). **956 tickets / 63 transcripts / 14 deals (11 lost, 3 in_progress) actually persisted.** Total cost **$1.22** on Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 (topped-up key). PHASE A1 IS COMPLETE.
5. [x] Verify: spot-checked planted deals + random tickets + segment distribution — all correct (see below). Full mentions-level verification happens after Phase A2 extraction.

**Provider saga (2026-07-20 evening — for context on why `.env.local` has 4 LLM keys):** Anthropic's original key ran out of credit 76% through a run (zero rows — `generate-data.ts` persists everything in ONE transaction at the very end, so a crash means nothing lands, not a partial write). Tried xAI (Grok) — account hit its spending limit on the first call. Tried Groq — code-verified working, but its structured-output-capable models cap at 200K tokens/day, about half the ~395K estimated need. Evaluated Cerebras (1M tokens/day but only 5 req/min → ~3.5-4hr run) but didn't commit. **Resolved by topping up the Anthropic account with a new key** — re-ran the full generation, verified success against live Postgres (not just the log), $1.22 total. `scripts/seed/llm.ts` now supports `GEN_PROVIDER=anthropic|google|openai|xai|groq|cerebras` if ever needed again.

**Real spot-check results (verified against actual Postgres data, not samples):**
- Planted blocked-deal accounts landed correctly: Retool→`usage_based_billing` ($204,507 lost), Airtable→`multi_entity_invoicing` ($737,096 lost), Attio→`salesforce_sync` ($67,232 lost) — ARR-scaled amounts, matches `opportunity-truth.json` exactly.
- Random ticket sample reads realistically and on-theme (dunning/webhook tickets sampled, correct severity register).
- Ticket count by account segment: 643 SMB / 229 mid-market / 84 enterprise — exactly the volume-trap shape the demo needs (lots of SMB noise, less enterprise signal, ARR-weighting will need to see through this at the ranking stage).

### Phase A2 — Extraction pipeline ✅ CODE DONE, quality-gate PASSED, pending live end-to-end run
1. [x] `lib/extraction/schema.ts` + `prompts.ts` + `model.ts` + `extract.ts` — closed-taxonomy Zod schema (dynamic from live theme ids), prompt requiring exact verbatim quotes, provider-agnostic model selection (`EXTRACT_PROVIDER`, defaults to Anthropic Haiku), and `extractMentions()` which computes char offsets by locating the LLM's snippet in the source text (never trusts LLM-reported offsets — they're routinely wrong).
2. [x] **THE CRITICAL QUALITY GATE — PASSED, well above the 80% bar.** Tested against 4 REAL generated documents (from the seed:dry samples, spanning usage_based_billing/dunning/latam_tax) covering all 20 extracted mentions: **20/20 correct theme classification, 20/20 exact-match verbatim offsets**, theme-appropriate severity (dunning=3-4, usage/latam=5), and one genuinely nuanced sentiment catch (a conditional-positive line correctly scored +1 inside an otherwise negative transcript). Zero cross-theme bleed (a dunning ticket mentioning "templates/branding" wasn't miscategorized into invoice_pdf).
3. [x] `lib/extraction/pipeline.ts` — the testable core logic: `extractMentionsForTicket`/`extractMentionsForTranscript` (LLM path, joins account arr/segment), `buildMentionForDealLoss` (**no LLM call** — a lost deal's `blocking_theme_id`+`loss_reason` already ARE the mention; severity is definitionally 5), `listPending*Ids()` enumerators. Typechecked; NOT yet runtime-tested (raw_tickets/deals are empty until Phase A1 step 4 persists — see above).
4. [x] `trigger/extract-mentions.ts` — thin Trigger.dev `task()` wrapper: `extractMentionsForSource` (per-source unit, batchTrigger fan-out target, inserts directly to ClickHouse so 5,000 runs stay independent) + `extractAllMentions` (orchestrator: loads themes + all pending ids, batchTriggers). Typechecked against the v3 SDK shape from `trigger.config.ts`; **UNVERIFIED against a live Trigger.dev dev server** (`TRIGGER_PROJECT_REF`/`TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` still placeholders) — smoke-test on one id before the full batchTrigger once `npx trigger.dev@latest dev` is running.
5. [ ] Run full extraction → ~5,000 mentions. **BLOCKED on Phase A1 step 4 + Trigger.dev project keys.**
6. [ ] Verify against ground truth: usage-billing highest enterprise-ARR weight, dunning highest raw count but low ARR, multi-entity few but high-ARR.

### Phase A3 — Query functions + agent (~5-7 hrs, the core)
1. Four query functions in `lib/queries/` returning `agent-tools.ts` shapes verbatim: `listOpportunitiesRanked`, `getThemeEvidence`, `getCompetitivePosition`, `getImpactProjection`.
   - [x] **`getCompetitivePosition`** (`competitive-position.ts`) — DONE, tested against live Postgres. Pure Postgres, no ClickHouse dependency. Real finding while testing: only `'full'` support counts as "a competitor has this" (not `'partial'`) — seed data has Adyen/Zuora at `'partial'` for multi-entity invoicing, and counting that as "has it" would have suppressed the frontend's greenfield/Open status for wow-moment #2. Verified: usage_based_billing shows Metronome/Orb ahead; multi_entity_invoicing shows zero rivals — matches `opportunity-truth.json`'s "greenfield" claim exactly.
   - [x] **`getThemeEvidence`** (`theme-evidence.ts`) — code done, typechecked. Two ClickHouse queries (capped severity-ranked evidence sample + uncapped per-account rollup — capping both would silently undercount "N accounts behind this theme"), one Postgres name lookup (account_name isn't denormalized onto mentions by design — this is the one place OLAP hands off to OLTP for "who"). **NOT YET runtime-verified** — needs live `mentions`.
   - [x] **`getImpactProjection`** (`impact-projection.ts`) — code done, typechecked. Definitions (documented in-file, same "propose now / review real output later" pattern as the scoring formula): `unblock`=lost deals blocked by the theme (hardest evidence), `risk`=in-progress deals blocked by the theme, `expansion`=accounts with ≥2 mentions/avg severity≥3 and NO deal record (latent upsell, not yet a deal). `confidence` derives from which tiers have data. **NOT YET runtime-verified.**
   - [x] **`listOpportunitiesRanked`** (`opportunities-ranked.ts` + `opportunity-scoring.ts`) — code done, typechecked. Split into pure scoring logic (unit-testable without a DB) and query orchestration.
2. [x] The 3 aggregate shapes Person B's transforms need — `lib/queries/signal-summary.ts`: `getSignalSummary()`, `getThemeVolumeStats()`, `getThemeTrends()`. Return the transforms' *input* types (`SignalSummary`/`ThemeVolumeStat`/`ThemeTrend`, defined in `transforms.ts` itself, not `types/chapter.ts` — a real import mistake caught and fixed while building this). `getThemeTrends` deliberately does NOT set `emphasized` — that's `toTrendLines`' job (acceleration heuristic), not the query layer's. **NOT YET runtime-verified.**
3. **THE SCORING FORMULA — implemented per user-approved design, PENDING REVIEW AGAINST REAL DATA (as agreed).** In `opportunity-scoring.ts`:
   ```
   signal_strength = 0.35×norm(enterprise_arr_weighted) + 0.25×norm(deal_loss_count)
                    + 0.20×norm(avg_severity) + 0.15×norm(mention_count) + 0.05×norm(recency_weighted)
   ```
   Min-max normalized 0-100 across the theme set. Deliberately does NOT weight raw mention_count heavily — that's the entire point of the volume-trap wow-moment. `recommendation` is a rule set on top (not a pure threshold): `build_now` requires signal≥70 AND a real lost-deal (hardest evidence); `build_next` requires signal≥55 AND (greenfield OR ≥3 enterprise accounts); `watch` requires signal≥35 AND rising recency share; else `deprioritize`. **USER: once Phase A2 extraction produces real mentions, I'll run this and show you the actual 8-theme ranked table (scores + recommendations) before treating it as final** — per your "propose now, review after" choice.
4. [x] Competitor feature→theme mapping — `lib/queries/competitor-feature-map.ts`. Hand-mapped all 20 features across the 8 themes (verified: sums to 20, no gaps/overlaps).
5. Implement `createAgentStream()` in `lib/agent-stream.ts` — the async generator yielding StreamEvents. Hybrid orchestration: scripted sequence for main flow. Honor per-chapter event order. **Not started** — the 4 query functions + 3 aggregate-shape functions it will call are now ready in code, but unverified against real data; building the stream generator before that verification risks compounding an unvalidated formula into the orchestration layer.
6. Build `chat.agent()` in `trigger/agent.ts` — system prompt + register 4 tools + chapter orchestration. Stubs exist: statusEvent, visualEvent, encodeNdjson. **Not started.**
7. Verify primary flow end-to-end: "what should we prioritize?" → all chapters stream → wow moments land. **Not started.**

**Verification debt (explicit, so nothing is silently assumed correct): `theme-evidence.ts`, `impact-projection.ts`, `opportunities-ranked.ts`, `signal-summary.ts`, and `extract-mentions.ts` (Trigger task) are all typechecked but NOT runtime-tested — every one of them queries the `mentions` ClickHouse table, which is empty until Phase A1 step 4 (generation) finishes AND Phase A2 step 5 (extraction) runs. `getCompetitivePosition` is the only query function verified against live data, because it's the only one with no `mentions` dependency.**

### Phase A4 — OLTP+OLAP sync + secondary tools (~3-4 hrs, bonus prize)
1. `trigger/sync-oltp-to-olap.ts` — scheduled task, propagates changed account/deal fields Postgres→ClickHouse.
2. Optional: simulated live ingestion task (adds a ticket every 10 min → shows real-time counter in demo).
3. Secondary tools: get_theme_trend, compare_themes, get_account_history.
4. Query optimization — target <500ms per query. Materialized views.
5. `docs/architecture.md` with Mermaid diagram (judges look at this for the bonus).

### Phase A5 — Deploy + submit (~2-3 hrs)
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel (env vars already mirrored), agent+tasks to Trigger.dev Cloud (`npx trigger.dev deploy`).
2. Submission materials (Person B drafting): 100-char title, 160-char tagline, 500-word summary, "how ClickHouse + Trigger.dev are used" paragraph.
3. Record demo video (max 5 min, OPEN WITH LIVE PRODUCT per handbook — no intro card). Show main flow + wow moments + drill-in.
4. Make repo public, add MIT LICENSE.
5. SUBMIT EARLY — morning of July 23, not midnight AoE.

## 6. KEY DECISIONS & CONSTRAINTS (do not violate)

- **ClickHouse must be primary DB, Postgres is OLTP** — both required for bonus prize. Do NOT collapse to one database.
- **Agent MUST use Trigger.dev `chat.agent()`** — required, disqualification otherwise. Both ClickHouse and Trigger.dev must be meaningfully used.
- **All code written during July 17-23** — no pre-existing code. Data-artifact JSON (design) was allowed pre-window; generator code was written in-window.
- **Gemini free tier: 15 RPM (Flash) / 30 RPM (Flash-Lite), 1,500 req/day** — lower generator concurrency, one full run/day.
- **File ownership:** Person A owns `/lib` (except transforms.ts + agent-stream.ts which B stubbed), `/trigger`, `/scripts`, `/data`, all SQL. Person B owns `/app`, `/components`, transforms, NDJSON/route wiring. Shared (PR only): `/types`, CLAUDE.md, .env.example.
- **Extraction quality gate is non-negotiable** — 20-sample manual check before full extraction.
- **themes.id is a TEXT slug** (e.g. 'usage_based_billing'), NOT a UUID — it's the join key across mentions/tools/seed. Everything else uses UUIDs.
- **Demo video opens with live product** — handbook requirement.

## 7. STYLE RULES (from CLAUDE.md)
TypeScript strict, no `any`, async/await, single quotes + semicolons, named exports (except Next.js page/layout/route), files <~200 lines, comments explain why not what.

## 8. JUDGING RUBRIC (for prioritization)
- Use of ClickHouse & Trigger.dev — 25%
- Problem Fit — 20%
- Technical Implementation — 20%
- Innovation — 20%
- Scalability & Impact — 10%
- Presentation — 5%
Plus bonus category: best OLTP+OLAP integration (€1000).

## 9. WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW (updated 2026-07-20, evening)
**PHASE A1 IS FULLY COMPLETE as of this update.** `db:init`, `seed:load`, `seed:dry`, and `seed:generate` all done and verified against live Postgres (956 tickets / 63 transcripts / 14 deals, $1.22 total cost). See §5 for full detail, including the provider saga (Anthropic → xAI → Groq → back to Anthropic with a topped-up key) and the real spot-check results. All of Phase A2 (extraction) and all four Phase A3 query functions were also written and typechecked while generation was blocked on billing issues — see §5's "verification debt" note for what's typechecked-only vs. runtime-verified.

**Immediate next action:** Phase A2 — set up the Trigger.dev Cloud project, then run extraction to populate ClickHouse `mentions`.

## 10. SINGLE-OWNER STATUS (updated 2026-07-20, night — Phase A1 complete)

**Ownership reality changed: as of this update, ONE person (Sparsh) is implementing the entire remaining project — frontend AND backend.** The original `CLAUDE.md` Person A / Person B split describes how the codebase got BUILT so far (accurate history, left as-is), but no longer describes who does what going forward. Treat every remaining task below as owned by whoever picks up this doc next, in the sequence given — there is no parallel track anymore, just a priority order.

### Where things stand right now
- **Phase A1 is done and verified.** All raw data is really in Postgres (checked with a live `SELECT count(*)`, not just trusting a log line — a prior run's misleading exit-code capture is exactly why that habit matters now). See §5 for the full provider saga and spot-check results.
- `.env.local`'s `GEN_PROVIDER` is `anthropic` (the working, topped-up key). Four other provider keys (xAI, Groq, Google, plus xAI/Groq/Cerebras SDK wiring) remain in `.env.local` and `scripts/seed/llm.ts` as fallbacks if ever needed for Phase A2 extraction (~5,000 calls, bigger than generation was) — Groq in particular is viable there since extraction's per-call token cost is much smaller than generation's, may fit under its 200K TPD cap where generation's ~395K didn't.
- Everything written this session (extraction pipeline, all 4 query functions, competitor mapping, multi-provider LLM support) is committed to `main` on GitHub and does NOT depend on any particular session staying alive — safe to pick up from a fresh environment.

### The sequential plan from here
1. **Set up the Trigger.dev Cloud project** (account, `TRIGGER_PROJECT_REF`, `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` into `.env.local`) — a dashboard/auth task, needs a human. This is now the single biggest blocker to running extraction and the agent for real.
2. **Run extraction** (`trigger/extract-mentions.ts` via `npx trigger.dev@latest dev`, or call `lib/extraction/pipeline.ts`'s functions directly from a script first to unblock faster if the Trigger.dev dev server setup is slow) → populates ClickHouse `mentions` (~5,000 rows expected).
3. **Verify the 4 query functions against real data** — run `listOpportunitiesRanked`, `getThemeEvidence`, `getImpactProjection`, `getThemeVolumeStats`/`getSignalSummary`/`getThemeTrends` and actually look at the output. **The scoring formula (§5 Phase A3 item 3) was implemented but explicitly deferred for review against real numbers — do that review now**, before treating any `build_now`/`build_next`/`deprioritize` call as final. Check it reproduces the demo narrative (§1): usage-billing #1, multi-entity hidden gem, dunning correctly deprioritized despite volume.
4. **Build `createAgentStream()`** (`lib/agent-stream.ts`) and **`chat.agent()`** (`trigger/agent.ts`) against the now-verified query functions. Hybrid orchestration per §2's decision (scripted main flow, LLM-driven follow-ups). Honor the per-chapter event order in §3.
5. **End-to-end test**: ask "what should we prioritize next quarter?" against the live agent, confirm all chapters stream, all three wow-moments land, provenance drill-down works.
6. **Phase A4** (bonus prize): `trigger/sync-oltp-to-olap.ts`, `docs/architecture.md` with a Mermaid diagram, query optimization pass.
7. **Phase A5** (deploy + submit): re-verify Vercel deploy, `npx trigger.dev deploy`, flip `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_MODE=live`, finalize `SUBMISSION.md` with real numbers, fix `README.md` (currently 2 lines), record the demo video (opens with live product, max 5 min), add MIT LICENSE, make repo public, submit early (morning of July 23, not midnight AoE).

### Independent, do whenever convenient (no dependency on the sequence above)
- Fix `README.md` — currently a 2-line placeholder.
- Stress-test the 7 chart components against larger data shapes than the hand-crafted mock uses (e.g. `evidence-cards` with 20 quotes, `opportunity-ranking` with all 8 themes) — the mock's tidy hand-picked numbers won't match real output's shape/volume.
- Draft the demo video shot list against the current mock — it already reproduces all three wow-moments; script now, re-record once live.
