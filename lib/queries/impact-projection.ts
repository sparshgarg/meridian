// Impact definitions (judgment calls — same "implement now, review real output
// before finalizing" approach approved for the opportunity-ranking formula):
//   unblock (pipeline_unblocked): deals ALREADY LOST to this theme. Hardest
//     evidence — a concrete deal record, not an inference.
//   risk (arr_at_risk): deals IN PROGRESS but blocked by this theme — live
//     pipeline that could still be lost if the gap isn't closed. (Existing-
//     customer churn risk isn't separately modeled — no signal in this schema
//     distinguishes "renewing customer unhappy" from "prospect mid-deal".)
//   expansion (expansion_potential): accounts with NO deal record for this
//     theme (so not already counted above) but repeated, meaningful mention
//     volume (>=2 mentions, avg severity >=3) — latent upsell demand that
//     hasn't become a deal yet.
